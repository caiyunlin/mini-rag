customer intent: As a developer or IT decision maker, I want a clear overview of Azure App Service features and supported workloads so that I can evaluate its fit for hosting my web applications, APIs, and back ends with minimal infrastructure management.

App Service overview
Azure App Service is a platform that lets you run web applications, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. Think of it as a powerful web hosting service that takes care of all the heavy lifting for you, so can focus on creating great applications.
App Service supports a variety of web stacks: .NET, Java (in Java SE, Tomcat, and JBoss flavors), Node.js, Python, and PHP, and can run them on both Windows and Linux. Or, if your app is containerized, you can just deploy it as a custom container.
Why Use Azure App Service?
Whether you're a student, a small business, a startup, or an enterprise, App Service offers a wide range of features tailored to meet your needs.
Students

Free access: In addition to the widely-available free tier, students can take advantage of the Azure for Students Starter program.
IDE support: Purpose-built deployment tools are available for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, and Eclipse.
Easy to use: Run your apps without needing experience in infrastructure management.
Learning Resources: Plenty of tutorials and guides to help you get started.

Small businesses and startups

Brand security: Protect your brand and your customers quickly with an App Service domain and a free managed certificate. Or, bring your domain and certificate to App Service.
Cost-effective: Pay only for the resources you use, and scale up or out with your business.
Command-line friendly: Deploy using command line tools you already use, such as Maven, Gradle, Azure Developer CLI, Azure CLI, and Azure PowerShell.
Scalability: Automatically scale your applications based on demand.
Global reach: Deploy your apps in data centers around the world.
Application templates: Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, Django , Node.js and Drupal.
Social sign-in support: Turn-key social sign-in with Google, Facebook, X, and Microsoft accounts.

Enterprises

CI/CD: Deploy continuously with GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, and more. Deploy predictably through staging environments.
High-density hosting savings: Run more applications on fewer VMs with the memory-optimized P*mv3 tiers, and save up to 55% on predictable workloads with Azure savings plans and reserved instances.
Full isolation: Secure ingress and egress with Azure Virtual Network integration, or run fully isolated applications with App Service environments, using dedicated networking and VMs.
Line-of-business: Develop business applications easily with built-in authentication, Microsoft Graph, and connectors to your line-of-business applications.
Reliability: Robust SLA and zone redundancy features help disaster-proof your application.
Security and compliance: ISO, SOC, and PCI compliance meet the strictest requirements of large enterprises.
